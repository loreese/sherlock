                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p> Our data revealed an interesting pattern of oriental assignment by the West in
                    this novel. Perhaps most interestingly in the way positive attributes were
                    detected in use around discussion of Eastern objects or persons. Our graphs both
                    illustrate this phenomena in their unique representations of our data.</p>
                <p> Our Sherlock and Watson chart reveals both these characters assigned positive
                    attitudes towards Eastern objects of exotice and undetermined types. This is
                    interesting to consider, as our hypothesis projected the East would not be
                    spoken of positively. Upon looking at these data points in the text, things
                    become even more interesting. The positive exotic and undetermined items
                    discussed are owned or possesed by a Western character, and are spoken of
                    favorably as a result. This reveals an aspect of Orientalism and the nefarious
                    nature of one culture defining what is "good" or "bad" about another; because
                    these Eastern objects are possessed by a Westerner, they are exotic and
                    favorable. Other objects, like those considered primitive, or people considered
                    violent, are cast in a negative or ambiguous light. This data reveals the
                    nuances of Victorian Orientalism and the British conceptualization of the
                    East.</p>
                <p> Our East and West chart also reveals surprising attitude assignments, this time
                    in the form of the way the west is framed. We accounted for both occidental and
                    oriental objects and people in this text, and our data shows several instances
                    in chapter 6 and 12 where Westerns are cast in a negative light. </p>
                <p> The example in chapter 6 of negative assignments of the Occident appear in the
                    case of Thaddeus Sholto's suspect staus following the murder of his brother. His
                    home that is full of "indian curosities" and the strange and foreign
                    "posionious" dart that killed his brother reflects negatively on him. The
                    objects work together to point to his guilt rather than serve as exotic
                    novelties.</p>
                <p> The examples in chapter 12 occurs in the case of Jonathan Small, the white,
                    English ex-con affiliated with the East and oriented against the Empire, as he
                    is the character who steals the treasure from the Sholoto's, who stole the
                    tresaure from India following the Sepoy Rebellion. Because of his actions
                    against the Empire, his relationship to the East, and his affiliation with
                    Tonga, the Andaman Islander with whom he carried out his revenge, Small's
                    actions are crimes against the British Empire, whereas the original theft of the
                    Agra treasure from its Indian origins is not even considered as a
                    wrongdoing.</p>
