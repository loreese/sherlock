                makes it a seminal text from the <em>fin-de-siecle</em> that explores the new
                discomfort with British Raj following the Sepoy Rebellion. The plot centers around
                the Agra treasure, a collection of precious gems, jewels, and metals, stolen by a

                Jonathan Small, an English convict who was in on other plans to steal this treasure,
                eventually steals it back from Sholto's son with the help of an Adaman Islander. The

            <br />
            <p> Orientalism refers to an outside, predjudice view of the Orient, or the East, in
                juxtaposition to the Occident, or the West. According to Edward Sais's seminal 1978
                text <cite>Orientalism,</cite> the term refers to the patronizing attitudes assigned
                by the West in its conception of the East and eastern cultures, viewing them as
                under developed and static states inferior to the West. The East referring to Middle
                Eastern, Asian, and North African countries, Said argues the West essentialzes these
                societies. </p>
            <p> Looking at Doyle's <cite>The Sign of the Four</cite> in light of this theory, its
                exploration of Colonial occupation and the Sepoy Rebellion make it an intersting
                item to investigate. As this plot center's around the Agra treasure, an object of
                Indian origin, the rightful possesion of the treasure comes down to a question of
                Empire.</p>
