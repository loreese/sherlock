                <p>This graph visualizes language used by Sherlock Holmes (S) and Dr. John Watson (W) throughout this text. 
                    It represents the positive, ambiguous, and negative attitudes towards Eastern objects and people. We
                    categorized these objects and people as being either primitive, violent, exotic, or an undetermined type to
                    represent how the most important Western characters in this work discussed things pertaining to the East. 
                </p>
                <p>In the chart, positive is represented by green, ambiguous is represented by yellow, and negative is represented by blue.</p>
                <!--#include virtual="../chart2.xhtml" -->
                <p>This graph visualizes the language in each chapter used to described either Eastern or Western objects or people and the positive, ambiguous, or negative attitudes 
                    assigned to them. </p>
                <p> In this graph, the West is represented by the stacks of red, orange, and yellow bars, while the East is represented by the stacks of green, blue, and violet bars.
                </p>

                <p>In addition to the graphic data we produced from our XML markup of <i><a href ="../booktext.xhtml">The Sign of the Four</a></i>, we added a 
                    checkbox to the text page. The checkbox was hard coded into the xhtml page and our group leader wrote a Java script
                    to enable the check boxes to interact with the text. The checkbox allows the user to interact with the text by seeing the types of descriptors used
                    by either Sherlock or Watson. The user can click on a character (or both) and then choose a part of speech to look at with the text. This gives the user 
                    the opportunity to see the words in context to get a picture of how orientalism was described in the text by the two main characters. We hope this feature
                    adds to the user's experience with our site and our research question.</p>
