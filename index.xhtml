                <p>Lauren Reese and Kelly O'Donnell undertook this project under the guidance of our
                    teaching assistant Zac Enick. Lauren is finishing up her B.A. in English
                    Literature, Kelly is working on her PhD in Commuication and Rhetoric in online
                    contexts, and Zac is about to graduate with his B.A. We have each brought our
                    unique persepctives to this project out of our interest in the digital
                    humanities and our love of Sherlock Holmes. We went through several ideas before
                    we settled on looking at how Orientalism was portrayed in Victorian times
                    through the lens of "The Sign of the Four," a stand alone Sherlock Holmes tale
                    written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and published in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine
                    in 1890.</p>
