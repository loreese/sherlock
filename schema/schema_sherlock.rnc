#as we come along any sources like the one listed above, add it to the @source list
#my logic with @source vs. @id is that an @source is a quoted publication, like the Gazetter, whereas the @id is for instances when someone references something someone else said.
#this is more often than not signified by single quotation marks inside a direct quote, and is really only relevant if what someone else said pertains to our research inquiry.
