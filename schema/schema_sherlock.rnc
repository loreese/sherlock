# to allow any combination of subq and desc, you'd use a vertical pipe "or selector" and write the following:
# q = element q { speaker, mixed { (subq | desc)* } }
# Above, this content model says "make a choice between subq and desc, make that choice 0 or more times,
# and mix plain text before, between, and/or after them.

#as we come along any sources like the one listed above, add it to the @source list

#this is more often than not signified by single quotation marks inside a direct quote, and is really only relevant if what someone else said pertains to our research inquiry.
